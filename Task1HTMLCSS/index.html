<p1>Hi,there! My name is Priyanka Thomas. I pursued my bachelor's in Computer Application. 
I had a subject particularly and a project during my last semester, where we had to make a website. During the period, I learned a lot about HTML & CSS.
I took a break after my course. Now im continuing my education.
About what I learned from my previous semester - as a beginner I really got a basic idea of how to develop an application. Looking forward to further learn from you. Thank You. </p1>
<h2 class="colored-heading">Your favorite Mobile application and why it is your favorite?</h2>

<h3 class="colored-heading">What you are looking forward to learning in this course?</h3>
